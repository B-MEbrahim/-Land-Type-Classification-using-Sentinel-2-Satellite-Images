# -Land-Type-Classification-using-Sentinel-2-Satellite-Images

## Overview
This project aims to build a robust deep learning model to classify various land types based on multispectral satellite images. By leveraging the power of **DNNs** and **Sentinel-2** imagery, this project will assist in various fields such as urban planning, agriculture, and environmental conservation.
